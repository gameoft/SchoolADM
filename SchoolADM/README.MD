### Requirements and dependencies
IMPORTANT:
**************************************
The additional packages have been removed to send a slimmer zip over the wire, as are the bin and obj folder. 
If you have the "Enable restore Nuget packages" option enabled on VS 2017 where you want to build the solution the packages will be automatically downloaded from Nuget.org 
(please check the Package Manager console for the actual Package source). 
If you don't have the option enabled you will have to enable it:
